# interactive-machine-learning-list

A collaborative list of interactive Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Stats websites. (Started by [Piotr Migda≈Ç](https://p.migdal.pl/), but anyone is encouraged to contribute!)

Right now check for [websites.yaml](https://github.com/stared/interactive-machine-learning-list/blob/master/websites.yaml).
I am developing [a no-build Vue.js website](http://p.migdal.pl/interactive-machine-learning-list/). Right now is in primordial stage (Web 1.0!) and contributions will be appreciated.

Feel invited to Pull Request other interactive visualizations! :)

Strong preference for open-source solutions.
